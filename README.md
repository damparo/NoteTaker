# NoteTaker

## Project Goal

The goal of this assignment was to create a note taker application that could be used to write, save, and delete notes.

## Functionality

The note taker uses express backend to save and retrieve data from a JSON file.  This was done by using api routes that could return saved notes, recieve a new note, or delete existing ones.

## Thoughts:

The delete note function works but does not target an individual note.

## Update:
The delete function needs to up improved so that it doesn't delete all the notes at once.
